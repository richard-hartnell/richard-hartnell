# Hi, welcome~

## I'm a new coder learning how to use GitHub.

### I'm a member of the Winter 2023 Generation USA cohort in a full-stack Java developer program, which ends in June.

#### If you're reading this, you're probably a hiring manager or colleague looking through my portfolio. By the time anybody's reading this, this will probably be full of code.
