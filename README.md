# Hi, welcome~

## I'm a new coder learning how to use GitHub.

### Member of the Winter 2023 Generation USA cohort in a [full-stack Java developer program](https://usa.generation.org/national/junior-full-stack-java-developer/#program-fit), which ends in June.

#### If you're reading this, you're probably a hiring manager or colleague looking through my portfolio. By the time anybody's reading this, this will hopefully be full of code.
