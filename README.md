# Hi, welcome~

I'm a coder and organizer from the west coast of the US (Bellingham, WA & Oakland, CA). I've been using mostly HTML/CSS/JS, Python, and some other programming languages here and there in the continual hunt for my forever stack. Right now I freelance in web dev while trying to shore up some fresh Rust skills, maybe finish an AWS cert, as well as creating some automation solutions that make my life easier while helping run [a real winsome harm reduction nonprofit](https://www.dancesafe.org).

- [My frontend portfolio](https://www.richardhartnell.com)
- [My SoundCloud](https://www.soundcloud.com/dawdust)

My current stack:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript / TypeScript
- Python w/Django
- React
- MySQL / Postgres
- Wordpress (usually with Divi)

A little sampler:

- [Three](https://www.theadmiraltylounge.com) [bar](https://www.bellaciao.bar) [websites](https://www.nachoproblematic.com)
- [A Reddit bot that distributes positive counterpropaganda about clowns](https://github.com/richard-hartnell/clown-bot)

Some interests right now:

- AI/ML
- custom APIs
- Raspberry Pi
- UI/UX
- "creativity" and algorithmic generation of music

A few certs:

Upcoming projects:

- Use PHP to create a teacher-editable class catalog for [my hometown circus cooperative](https://www.bellinghamcircusguild.com)
- Use JS to build a public-facing housing model ([WIP proof-of-concept site](https://www.dissolvingequity.org)) called the "dissolving-equity [land trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_land_trust)" to help fix the housing crisis
