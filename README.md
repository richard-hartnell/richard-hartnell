# Hi, welcome~

### I'm a coder from the west coast of the US. I've been mucking about with HTML for many years, Python for a few years, and most recently I graduated from the the Winter 2023 Generation USA cohort in a [full-stack Java developer program](https://usa.generation.org/national/junior-full-stack-java-developer/#program-fit), which ended in June.
